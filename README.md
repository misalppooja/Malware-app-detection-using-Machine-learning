# Malware-app-detection-using-Machine-learning

Project Name: Malware app detection using Machine Learning                                                                                 Description: Developed a data science project addressing Android's
susceptibility to malware attacks from real-world data, leveraging Na√Øve Bayes
classification, decision tree, and ensemble learning approach based on Random
Forest and Adaboost. Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using
Pandas, and Matplotlib and also successfully tackled the challenge of
imbalanced dataset to build model using Scikit-learn. Achieved optimal results
with Random Forest, detecting the malicious apps for enhanced cybersecurity. Demonstrated
use of data analysis and machine learning to safeguard Android users from
potential malware apps.
